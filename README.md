## Usage

To use this website the user only need to click the generate password button to begin the process. The user will then be prompted for what type of characters they want in their password, uppercase, lowercase, special, and numerical. Then the user is prompted with an input field to indicate how many characters they wish the password to be. If the user doesn't select any of the character option then the user is alerted to the mistake and the process ends. If the user either doesn't input a number or inputs one less than 8 or greater than 128 then the user is informed of the mistake and the process is exited. After the user inputs have been gathered then the random password is generated and printed to the text box of the page where the user can then copy it.
